Description: Analysis of lable free proteomics data in R.
    Includes data normalization, gamma regression to establish mean-variance 
    trends that is to remove mean-variance trends in the data as well as 
    adaptive inference of standard deviation for imputation.
    It uses limma for significance test, and generates multiple 
    imputations to reduce type-I error from the imputation.
